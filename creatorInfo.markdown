Hello my name is Jonas Nilsson and I'm 26 years old. I live in Kalmar which is also where I was born and raised.
My hobbies are to play games, watch anime, read manga and listen to music. I really love anime and manga and the japanese langauge. When I was 20, I decided that I wanted to study japanese. So I started to look around for the hows and where.
I then came accross a site that would help me to apply to a language shcool in Japan. That sounds amazing was my first thought, you both get to go to the country and learn the language at the same time.

It was bit scary in the beginning since I went there alone and didn't know anyone there, but in the same time it was really exciting and I could really feel like it would be a super good life experience for me. I lived in Tokyo for 2 years before I had to move back to Sweden. At first the language was quite difficult but the teachers were really good and it was all fun. As they often say time flies when you have fun. Because those 2 years flew by like noones buisness.
I really miss that time and all the fun things you could do there so my plans are to go back for a visit atleast and perhaps move there again. 

I watch anime on a daily basis and I watch most of the categories. There is alot of different animes that you can watch.
You have genres like: Slice of life, Horror, Action, Fantasy, Sports and many many more.
