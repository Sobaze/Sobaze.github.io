- How did I implement Comments on my blog posts?

I implemented comments on my webpage by using disqus. I went to the site and created an account, after that I used the universal code and I copied the given code there into my post.html file. I thought it fitted in there pretty good so you can comment inside of the blos posts of what you think about given content.


- What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Open graph is a tehcnology that Facebook introduced for the first time back in 2010. It allows intergation between Facebook and its user data and a website. By intergrating Open graph meta tags on your websites content, you can you can decide what elements you want to show when someone shares your website. If you specify your meta tags Facebook doesn't have to guess what information to use when your website is shared.
