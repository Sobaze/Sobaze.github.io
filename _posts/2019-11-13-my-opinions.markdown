Pre-compiling CSS. What do i think of it?

- Comparison between pre-compiled CSS and regular CSS.
CSS is the styling language that is understandable by every browser out there to style the webpages.
SCSS is special type of file for SASS, that is a program that is written in Ruby. It collects CSS style sheets for a browser. SASS adds alot of extra functionality to CSS, you can use variables and nesting. This can make the writing of CSS abit easier. 

- Techniques I used
I used pre-compiled CSS from the minima file that was included in the assignment and then made some changes in the looks of it.

- Pros and cons.

At first pre-compiled CSS looked very scary and hard to understand since it was new, but there is a few stuff with it that makes it better to use. One is that it is able to have nested syntaxed in your css files, which normal css don't have yet. You also have the ability the define your own variables with it and you have the possibility of doin mathematical and operational("darken" and "lighten" for example) functions. When using precompiled CSS you can write DRY code, which means you dont have to repeat you code.

Some of the cons with it is if everyone on your team doesnt know how it works it will mess with your work. A very easy mistake to make with this is also that you can nest abit too much which makes the css much harder to understand, also over-use of mixins is something you should be vary of. Also debugging becomes harder.





- Static site generators. What do i think of it?

Static site generators sounds like a really neat thing for people who are satisfied with a bit smaller sites and it also sounds bit more secure since with a static site you have already given out the info and there is nothing to hack, like the backend or something similiar. 

It is like a middleground between a static site and dynamic content management system, like wordpress.  The dynamic content management system can sometimes be an overkill which is why static site generators are a good thing.

- What type of projects are they suitable for?

It feels like its more suitable for when you want to make abit of a smaller project and not something super big.
